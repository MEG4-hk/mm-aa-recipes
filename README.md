Auther: Lior Levin

Date: 2022/04/21

## Usage
- Find the Project Ozone 3 instance folder (usually located at `<CurseForge's installation folder>/Instances/Project Ozone 3 A New Way Forward`). You can browse it yourself, or alternatively - at the CurseForge client, select `Project Ozone 3` under the `My Modpacks` tab, click on the 3 dots left of the `Play` button, and choose `Open Folder`.
- Inside the PO3 folder, enter `config/modularmachinery/recipes`.
- Copy all 12 files in the *repository*'s `recipes` folder to the *installation*'s `recipes` folder you found in the previous step.
- If your game is open, press `F3 + T` to reload all resources.
- If the recipes still aren't available, try fully restarting your game.

## Note
This was made very quickly, with no previous knowledge about the mod's configuration, so there are probably some issues I am not aware of. Please notify me of any errors or problems with these recipes if you encounter any.
